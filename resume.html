                    <p>
                        Analyst working in higher education who enjoys solving problems and building tools that help organizations use data to plan and make better decisions. I have obtained my masterâ€™s degree and have 5+ years of technical experience with strong skill sets in Business Intelligence and Data Science. Recently I have completed the Applied Data Science program through MIT (gaining skills in machine learning, deep learning, and recommendation systems) and other professional development work to improve in the areas of Data and Computer Science.

                    <h2>Projects</h2>
                <!-- Project 1 -->
                    <h3>Applicant Conversion Predictive Modeling</h3>
                    <p>
                        Designed a predictive model for Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU Campus) that predicts the applicant-to-student conversion rate. This model was used to support and craft an institutional scholarship (discounting) strategy to increase the conversion rate and sustain an enrollment growth plan while maintaining a low marginal cost per acquisition.
                    </p>
                <!-- Project 2 -->
                    <h3>Enrollment and Revenue Forecasting</h3>
                        <p>
                            Established an enrollment and revenue forecast for SNHU Campus using a suite of machine learning models to predict new student enrollment and current student re-enrollment across many different student segments and program offerings. The results of this forecast alerted university leadership of the need to make improvements to its student retention and acquisition strategies.
                    </p>
                <!-- Project 3 -->
                    <h3>Program Health Portfolio Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        Constructed a program review tool for the campus president and leadership at SNHU Campus that established a clear picture of program health across all academic offerings. This tool (which included many financial, market demand, and academic health metrics) become a one-stop-shop document for collaboration between program chairs and leadership. Lastly, a clustering algorithm was used to generate groups of like programs to produce initiatives for improving program health.
