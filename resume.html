                    <h2>Projects</h2>
  
                    <h3>Applicant Conversion Predictive Modeling</h3>
                    <p>
                        Designed a predictive model for Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU Campus) that predicts the applicant-to-student conversion rate. This model was used to support and craft an institutional scholarship (discounting) strategy to increase the conversion rate and sustain an enrollment growth plan while maintaining a low marginal cost per acquisition.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Enrollment and Revenue Forecasting</h3>
                        <p>
                            Established an enrollment and revenue forecast for SNHU Campus using a suite of machine learning models to predict new student enrollment and current student re-enrollment across many different student segments and program offerings. The results of this forecast alerted university leadership of the need to make improvements to its student retention and acquisition strategies.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Program Health Portfolio Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        Constructed a program review tool for the campus president and leadership at SNHU Campus that established a clear picture of program health across all academic offerings. This tool (which included many financial, market demand, and academic health metrics) become a one-stop-shop document for collaboration between program chairs and leadership. Lastly, a clustering algorithm was used to generate groups of like programs to produce initiatives for improving program health.
